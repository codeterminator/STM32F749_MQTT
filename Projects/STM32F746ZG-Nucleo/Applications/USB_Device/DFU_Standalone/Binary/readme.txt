@par Application Description 

This directory contains a binary template (in DFU format) to be loaded into Flash memory using Device 
Firmware Upgrade application. This file was converted to the DFU format using the "DFU File Manager Tool"
included in the "DfuSe" PC software install.
For more details on how to convert a .bin file to DFU format please refer to the UM0412 user manual 
"Getting started with DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade STMicroelectronics extension" available from the
STMicroelectronics microcontroller website www.st.com.
   
This binary is a simple LED chaser. The 4 LEDs lights one by one for a period of 100 ms and the cycle 
repeats giving the running light appearance.
The system Timer (Systick) is used for to generate the delay.
The offset address of this binary is 0x08008000 which matches the definition in DFU application
"USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD".

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
