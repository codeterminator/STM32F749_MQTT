@par Application Description 

How to configure and use the FLASH HAL API to erase and program the internal
Flash memory.
  
At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 216 MHz. 

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. A dedicated function
is used to enable the FLASH control register access.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase sector feature. The erase procedure is done by filling the erase init 
structure giving the starting erase sector and the number of sectors to erase.
At this stage, all these sectors will be erased one by one separately.

@note: if problem occurs on a sector, erase will be stopped and faulty sector will 
be returned to user (through variable 'sectorError').

Once this operation is finished, sector word programming operation will be performed 
in the FLASH memory. The written data is then read back and checked.

The NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B board LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when there are no errors detected after programmation
 - LED1 is blinking with a 1s period when there are errors dectected after programmation
 - LED1 is blinking (100ms on, 2s off) when there is an issue during erase or program procedure

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
