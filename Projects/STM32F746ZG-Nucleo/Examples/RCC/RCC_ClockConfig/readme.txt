@par Example Description 

Configuration of the system clock (SYSCLK) and modification of the clock settings in Run mode, using the RCC HAL API. 

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source, the User push-button (connected to EXTI15_10) will be 
used to change the PLL source: 
- from HSI to HSE
- from HSE to HSI

Each time the User push-button is pressed; EXTI15_10 interrupt is generated and in the ISR
the PLL oscillator source is checked using __HAL_RCC_GET_PLL_OSCSOURCE() macro:

- If the HSE oscillator is selected as PLL source, the following steps will be followed to switch 
   the PLL source to HSI oscillator:
     a- Switch the system clock source to HSE to allow modification of the PLL configuration
     b- Enable HSI Oscillator, select it as PLL source and finally activate the PLL
     c- Select the PLL as system clock source and configure the HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 clocks dividers
     d- Disable the HSE oscillator (optional, if the HSE is no more needed by the application)


- If the HSI oscillator is selected as PLL source, the following steps will be followed to switch 
   the PLL source to HSE oscillator:
     a- Switch the system clock source to HSI to allow modification of the PLL configuration
     b- Enable HSE Oscillator, select it as PLL source and finally activate the PLL
     c- Select the PLL as system clock source and configure the HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 clocks dividers
     d- Disable the HSI oscillator (optional, if the HSI is no more needed by the application)

In this example the SYSCLK  / 4 is outputted on the MCO2 pin(PC.09).
In this example the HSE  / 4 is outputted on the MCO1 pin(PA.08).


LED1 is toggled with a timing defined by the HAL_Delay() API.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F746xG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
