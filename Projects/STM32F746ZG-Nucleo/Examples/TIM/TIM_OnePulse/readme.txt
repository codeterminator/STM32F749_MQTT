@par Example Description 

Use of the TIM peripheral to generate a single pulse when 
an external signal rising edge is received on the timer input pin.

Clock setup for TIM3
================================

  TIM3CLK = SystemCoreClock = 216 MHz.
  
  Prescaler = (TIM3CLK /TIM3 counter clock) - 1
  
  The prescaler value is computed in order to have TIM3 counter clock 
  set at 18000000 Hz.
  
  The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM3->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
  trigger the TIM3 input is 18000000/65535 [Hz].
 
Configuration of TIM3 in One Pulse Mode
===================================================
 
  - The external signal is connected to TIM3_CH2 pin (PB.05), 
    and a rising edge on this input is used to trigger the Timer.
  - The One Pulse signal is output on TIM3_CH1 (PB.04).

  The delay value is fixed to:
   - Delay =  CCR1/TIM3 counter clock 
           = 16383 / 18000000 [sec]
           
  The pulse value is fixed to : 
   - Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM3 counter clock  
                 = (65535 - 16383) / 18000000 [sec]

  The one pulse waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope and it looks
  like this.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32F746xG devices.
   - In this example, the clock is set to 216 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B board Set-up
   - Connect the external signal to the TIM3_CH2 pin (PB.05) (CN7, pin 13)
   - Connect the TIM3_CH1 pin(PB.04) (CN7, pin 19) to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.  


@par How to use it ?
