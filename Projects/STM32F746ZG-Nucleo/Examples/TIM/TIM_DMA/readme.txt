@par Example Description 

Use of the DMA with TIMER Update request 
to transfer data from memory to TIMER Capture Compare Register 3 (TIM3_CCR3).

  The following configuration values are used in this example:

    - TIM3CLK = SystemCoreClock
    - Counter repetition = 3 
    - Prescaler = 0 
    - TIM3 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
    - SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F7xx

  The objective is to configure TIM3 channel 3 to generate complementary PWM 
  (Pulse Width Modulation) signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz, and a variable 
  duty cycle that is changed by the DMA after a specific number of Update DMA request.

  The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM3 Repetition counter,
  each 4 Update Requests, the TIM3 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
  value defined by the aCCValue_Buffer.
  
  The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.
 
  In nominal mode (except at start) , it should looks like this :
    
       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   
        ___________     _______         ___             ___________    __
      _|           |___|       |_______|   |___________|           |__|             
       <----57us -----><----57us -----><----57us -----><----57us ----->



@note PWM signal frequency value mentioned above is theoretical (obtained when the system clock frequency 
      is exactly 216 MHz). Since the generated system clock frequency may vary from one board to another observed
      PWM signal frequency might be slightly different.
	  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F746xG devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 216 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B
    board Rev.B and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
   
  - LED3 is ON when an error occurs.
  - LED1 is always ON because the TIM channel CH3 is configured on the PB.00 pin too.

  - NUCLEO-746ZG Rev.B board Set-up
    - Connect the TIM3 pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms: 
    - TIM3 CH3 (PB.00) is connected to Ardiuno D33 : pin 31 on CN10 Connector

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
